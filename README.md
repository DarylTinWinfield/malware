# About payment skimming and Magecart

Online payment skimming (aka "MageCart") is a growing threat to digital stores. Since our first publication in [2015](https://sansec.io/research/widespread-credit-card-hijacking-discovered/), we identified more than [40.000 compromised stores](https://twitter.com/gwillem/status/1050480393743491074). In most cases, malware is inserted that will a) intercept customer data, b) divert payments or c) uses your customers for cryptojacking.

Privacy watchdogs and online regulators are increasingly handing out fines to companies who suffered a Magecart attack.
