# Magento Malware Scanner

Online payment skimming (aka "MageCart") is a large threat to digital stores. Since I first published about it in [2015](https://gwillem.gitlab.io/2015/11/17/widespread-credit-card-hijacking-discovered/), I have identified more than [40.000 compromised stores](https://twitter.com/gwillem/status/1050480393743491074). In most cases, malware is inserted that will a) intercept customer data, b) divert payments or c) uses your customers for cryptojacking.

# Commercial scanner now available

This opensource scanner **is no longer maintained as of 2018**. However, I now offer a commercial scanner + signature subscription called **eComscan**. It contains another 4000 previously unpublished signatures, and is updated 24/7 with new threat intel. I am actually quite proud to have built the best Magecart scanner that exists today. [Download your copy here](https://sansec.io/?mwscan) and get one month free using code "MWSCAN".
