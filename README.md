# Who uses it?

I originally created MageReport, which kickstarted my research into online skimming. Besides MageReport, my scanning technology is currently [recommended by Magento](https://magento.com/security/best-practices/detect-malware-new-discovery-rules) and used by the [US Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/topic/cybersecurity), the [Magento Marketplace](https://twitter.com/jason_c_cochran/status/850043415194685441), [Magereport](https://www.magereport.com), the [Mage Security Council](https://magesec.org) and [many others](docs/who-is-using.md).

# About payment skimming and Magecart

Online payment skimming (aka "MageCart") is a large threat to digital stores. Since I first published about it in [2015](https://sansec.io/research/widespread-credit-card-hijacking-discovered/), I have identified more than [40.000 compromised stores](https://twitter.com/gwillem/status/1050480393743491074). In most cases, malware is inserted that will a) intercept customer data, b) divert payments or c) uses your customers for cryptojacking.
