# March 2019: Commercial malware scanner now available

The opensource malware scanner **is no longer maintained as of 2018**. However, my company Sanguine Security now offers a commercial scanner + signature subscription called **eComscan**. It contains another 4000 private signatures, and is updated 24/7 with new threat intel. I am actually quite proud to have built the best Magecart scanner that exists today.

**Looking to resolve or prevent a breach?** [Download your copy here](https://sansec.io/?mwscan) and get one month free using code "MWSCAN". 

Features:
 - Best & fastest detection. eComscan is usually weeks ahead of other anti-virus solutions. 
 - Quickly identify malicious code.
 - Continuous monitoring of files and databases.
 - Finds malware and vulnerabilities.
 - Get instant and actionable alerts.
 - Supports Magento 1, Magento 2, Prestashop, Shopware and Woocommerce.

# Who uses it?

I originally created MageReport, which kickstarted my research into online skimming. Besides MageReport, my scanning technology is currently [recommended by Magento](https://magento.com/security/best-practices/detect-malware-new-discovery-rules) and used by the [US Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/topic/cybersecurity), the [Magento Marketplace](https://twitter.com/jason_c_cochran/status/850043415194685441), [Magereport](https://www.magereport.com), the [Mage Security Council](https://magesec.org) and [many others](docs/who-is-using.md).

# About payment skimming and Magecart

Online payment skimming (aka "MageCart") is a large threat to digital stores. Since I first published about it in [2015](https://gwillem.gitlab.io/2015/11/17/widespread-credit-card-hijacking-discovered/), I have identified more than [40.000 compromised stores](https://twitter.com/gwillem/status/1050480393743491074). In most cases, malware is inserted that will a) intercept customer data, b) divert payments or c) uses your customers for cryptojacking.
